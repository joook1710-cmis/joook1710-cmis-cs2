#Part 1: Terminology (15 points)
#1 1pt) What is the symbol "=" used for?
# It is used to define a function. 
#
#
#2 3pts) Write a technical definition for 'function'
# Function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. 
# When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. 
#
#3 1pt) What does the keyword "return" do?
# When a function is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something. When the user presses return, the program resumes and the output comes out. 
#
#
#4 5pts) We know 5 basic data types. Write the name for each one and provide two
#   examples of each below
#	1: String
# "Hello world" / "I love you" / str(44) 
#	2: Tuple
# ("Hello", "Yo", 44) / (1, 2, 3, 4)
#	3: Boolean 
# 4 < 5 / 2 = 1 
#	4: Integer
# 4 / int("hello")
#	5: Floating point 
# float(0.1) / float(3.7) 
 
#5 2pts) What is the difference between a "function definition" and a 
#        "function call"?
# Function call operator is used for operations that require a number of parameters. This works because expression list is a list instead of a single operand. 
# Programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library. And function definition is used to define what is kept in the library. 
#
#
#6 3pts) What are the 3 phases that every computer program has? What happens in
#        each of them
#	1: Input 
# Collection refers to gathering the data from a variety of sources and assembling it. Verification means checking the data to determine whether it is accurate and complete. 
#	2: Process
# one or more of tasks may be performed on the input data. 
#	3: Output 
# Data are organized by characteristics meaninggul to the user. The user needs to call the function to bring out the output.
 
#Part 2: Programming (25 points)
#Write a program that asks the user for the areas of 3 circles.
#It should then calculate the diameter of each and the sum of the diameters 
#of the 3 circles.
#Finally, it should produce output like this:

import math 
def int( e, x):
	return e * x
def output ( e, x, y):
	return out 

def main():
	e= raw_input("c1: ")
	x= raw_input("c2: ")
	y= int(raw_input("c3: "))
	
main()




#Circle  Diameter
#c1      ...
#c2      ...
#c3      ...
#TOTALS  ...

# Hint: Radius is the square root of the area divided by pi
